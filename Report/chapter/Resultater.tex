The robot is implemented with a particle filter and a A* search algorithm that helps it localize and navigate trough the known map.

The robot was placed between two obstacles and with the help of the particle filter and A* it needed to navigate down to the left lower corner.

When looking at the particles they represents very well the location of the robot.
