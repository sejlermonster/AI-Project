\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conc}

This project has dealt with implementing a solution for a kidnapped robot problem. The project implements filters and algorithms from the course to make a robot that has the basics for Artificial Intelligence. 

Through implementing Robot Motion, Localization, a Particle filter and an A* algorithm, the robot is able to find its way to the goal destination without knowing its initial position, thus solving the kidnapped robot problem. However uncertainty in the hardware of the Lego Mindstorm EV3 makes the robots precision unstable. It varies how precisely the robot lands on the goal destination, since the movements of the robot is not precise. This is mostly due to unstable sensors. 

The difference in real-world scenarios and theory becomes clear when looking at  results for the simulated Particle filter and the implemented Particle filter. While the filter essentially works in both instances, the unstable movement of the robot makes some of the measurements for the Particle filter unusable.

The final implementation of the project is working to a satisfactory level, and uses the most important subjects of the course.
