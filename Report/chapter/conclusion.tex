This project has dealt with implementing a solution for the kidnapped robot problem. The project has successfully implemented filters and algorithms within the field of Artifical Intelligence presented in the course \emph{AI in Robotics}.

Through implementing Robot Motion, Localization, a Particle filter and an A* algorithm, the robot is able to find its way to the goal destination without knowing its initial position, thus solving the kidnapped robot problem. However uncertainty in the hardware of the Lego Mindstorm EV3 makes the robots precision unstable. It varies how precisely the robot lands on the goal destination, since the movements of the robot are not precise. This is mostly due to unstable sensors. A way of solving this could be sensor fusion and implementing a PID controller.

The difference in real-world scenarios and theory becomes clear when looking at  results for the simulated Particle filter and the implemented Particle filter. While the filter essentially works in both instances, the unstable measurements of the robot makes some of the measurements for the Particle filter unusable.

The implemented project is working to a satisfactory level, and it uses essential concepts from the course \emph{AI in Robotics}.
