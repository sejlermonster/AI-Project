\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:intro}

This report is a part of the developed project in the course \emph{AI in Robotics} at Aarhus University Department of Engineering.

In the report the theory of the course is briefly explained. This includes different techniques for localization, path finding and control. These techniques are described in Part \ref{part:theory} of the report in Chapters \ref{chp:local}, \ref{chp:kalman}, \ref{chp:partFilter}, \ref{chp:search}, \ref{chp:pid} and \ref{chp:slam}

In Part \ref{part:project} of the report the developed project is described. This project tries to solve \emph{Kidnapped robot problem} and after localization it must use path finding to drive to a predefined location.

The Lego Mindstorm robot includes to motors used for driving. A gyroscope is used for more correctly turning the robot. A Ultra sound sensor is used for calculating the distance to objects. The developed software for the robot implements a particle filter to localize the position of the robot. Furthermore A* is implemented for path finding.
